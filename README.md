The disaster map is a web mapping platform and consumer application that offers satellite imagery, aerial photography and street maps. It features real time conditions of your location if there's any calamity happening and features different icons stating the nature of the calamity. The Satellite Image Processing feature uses an AlexNet which is a leading architecture for object detection to classify the satellite image based on the damage it has dealt. We also have a chatterbot that uses Alan AI. Alan AI is a complete voice AI platform. It increases app adoption through voice onboarding. It also provides a personalized voice experience for every user. The chat bot responds to SOS messages and sends a relief team to the coordinates. It can also answer questions with respect to the calamities. There is a FAQ section that takes you through how to use the web application and answers any other queries the user may have.
